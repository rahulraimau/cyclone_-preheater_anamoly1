📊 Cyclone Preheater Anomaly Detection Report
👨‍💻 Prepared by: Rahul Rai
📅 Date: August 1, 2025
📁 Dataset: internship-data-1.csv
📌 Records: 5,200 rows, 7 columns
1. 📂 Data Preparation
We began by loading the raw sensor data from the preheater cyclone unit. Key preprocessing steps included:

Datetime Parsing: Converted the time column to pandas datetime for accurate time-based indexing and visualization.

Missing Values: Handled using forward-fill (ffill) to maintain temporal continuity.

Feature Engineering:

Added hour, day, and weekday for time series analysis.

Calculated rolling statistics (mean, std) for contextual analysis.

Normalization: Standardized values using StandardScaler for model consistency.

Label Creation: Anomaly labels created based on z-score thresholding (z > 3) and model consensus.

2. 🧠 Analysis Strategy
We employed a multi-model anomaly detection approach:

Model	Description
Z-Score	Statistical outlier detection based on z-score > 3
Isolation Forest	Tree-based model that isolates anomalies early
One-Class SVM	Learns the boundary of normal class
AutoEncoder (optional)	Neural network reconstruction error scoring

Voting Strategy: Final anomaly label = Timestamp flagged by ≥2 models.

3. 📍 Insights and Results
✅ 437 timestamps were consistently flagged as anomalous by at least two models.
📈 The majority of anomalies occurred during the following periods:

Early mornings (2–4 AM) and post-maintenance hours (12–2 PM)

Top features affected:

Cyclone_Inlet_Gas_Temp

Cyclone_Material_Temp

Cyclone_Gas_Outlet_Temp

🛠 Anomaly Ranges
Feature	Min	Max	Anomaly Thresholds
Cyclone_Inlet_Gas_Temp	480	730	z-score > 3
Cyclone_Material_Temp	540	800	z-score > 3
Cyclone_Outlet_Gas_draft	-150	50	Isolation Forest
Cyclone_cone_draft	-120	40	One-Class SVM
Cyclone_Gas_Outlet_Temp	450	780	Autoencoder
Cyclone_Inlet_Draft	-130	60	Isolation Forest
