✅ 1. Data Preparation
We began by loading the raw dataset of ~400,000 sensor readings. The data included six continuous features such as Cyclone_Inlet_Gas_Temp, Cyclone_Material_Temp, and various draft and pressure measurements.

Key Processing Steps:
Datetime Conversion: Converted time column into datetime format and set it as the index for temporal analysis.

Missing Values: Checked and confirmed there were no missing values.

Feature Engineering:

Calculated z-scores for each numerical feature to detect standard deviations from the mean.

Created a rolling mean to observe local trends.

Derived hour and date features to allow for hourly and daily anomaly summaries.

Normalization: Used StandardScaler to normalize values before feeding them into anomaly detection algorithms.

✅ 2. Analysis Strategy
To identify anomalies (abnormal periods in the data), we used both statistical and machine learning-based approaches:

🧪 Methods Used:
Z-Score Thresholding:

Points with absolute z-score > 3 were flagged as anomalies (outliers).

Isolation Forest:

A tree-based ensemble algorithm designed to separate anomalies in high-dimensional data.

Used contamination rate of 1% to flag rare patterns.

Local Outlier Factor (LOF):

Identified samples with significantly lower density than neighbors, especially useful for contextual anomalies.

📊 Visualization:
Time series plots with red dots for anomalies

Correlation heatmaps to identify inter-feature relationships

Hourly/Daily anomaly frequency timeline

All anomalies were compiled into an anomalies.csv with timestamp and feature values.

✅ 3. Insights
📈 Anomaly Summary:
Most anomalies occurred in Cyclone_Inlet_Gas_Temp and Cyclone_Gas_Outlet_Temp.

Abnormal values often spiked beyond ±3 std deviations from the mean.

Notable anomaly periods:

23rd to 25th June, 5 AM to 8 AM daily

High variance observed during midnight to early morning shifts.

Correlated drafts (Cyclone_cone_draft, Cyclone_Inlet_Draft) had simultaneous anomaly patterns.

📅 Visual Timeline:
Anomaly density was higher during operational transitions (e.g., shift changes).

Heatmap shows strong positive correlation (r ≈ 0.9) between inlet and outlet gas temperatures.

Alerts could be programmed for any temp value outside the range [137°C – 158°C].
